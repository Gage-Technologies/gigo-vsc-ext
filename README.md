# GIGO Visual Studio Code Extension

GIGO VSC Extension is an all encompassing vscode extension that assists users inside of the GIGO workspace system.

## Getting Started

When you install Auto-Git, it will look for a workspace/folder which has to be a git-repository. If not, the extension will be disabled automatically. So make sure you work in a git-repository. This extension will also append his own directories into the .gitignore file to prevent getting uploaded to the git. If you dont have a .gitignore file, one will be created by default.
