# Auto-Git

Auto-Git is an extension to push project files to git in a predefined interval without taking any action by the developer.

## Getting Started

When you install Auto-Git, it will look for a workspace/folder which has to be a git-repository. If not, the extension will be disabled automatically. So make sure you work in a git-repository. This extension will also append his own directories into the .gitignore file to prevent getting uploaded to the git. If you dont have a .gitignore file, one will be created by default.

## Prerequisites

Using Auto-Git from scratch with a fresh git repository.

Your steps are easy and also a common route to work with git: make a git repository with init, setup remote data and choose upstream branch

```
git init
git remote add origin <url>
git fetch origin
git pull origin master
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
```

If you are working within another branch beside master, so do not forget to switch into it using:

```
git checkout <branch>
```

I would prefer to use the git credential.helper for remembering username and password for the remote git.

Linux:

```
git config --global credential.helper store
or
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

MacOSX:

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

Windows:
For Windows, there is a helper called [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) by Microsoft

```
git config --global credential.helper wincred # obsolete
```

also do not forget to setup user.name and user.email

```
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

After you created a git-repository, restart Visual Studio Code or reopen the workspace/folder. The extension recognizes it as a git repository and start automatically with predefined settings.

## Settings

There will be a **.autogit** directory with logs folder and a **autogit.json** file. You can change some behavoir like interval, logging and silent-mode in the json file.
After changing any value in the json file, you should stop and start the extension to reload the configuration. This can be done by restarting VS Code or using the extension commands.

- `runOnStart`: If true, auto-git will automatically start push cycle by given interval (see below `updateInterval`) when opening workspace (which is a git-repository).
- `logging`: Creates a log file (date based) in the .autogit/logs folder. It contains all changes from last push cycle (add/remove/modified/delete). So you can always see what happened during the push cycle. Setting to false will prevent creating log files.
- `silent`: If false, every finished push cycle, a vscode notification box will show up.
- `updateInterval`: Interval is given in seconds. Defines how long a cycle takes to push added/removed/modified/deleted files to git.
- `commitMessage`: Here you can override the default auto-git commit message.
- commitMessage optional `placeholders`:

```
{ts} represents seconds (as integer) from 1970-01-01 till now (unix timestamp)

{ts.utc} represents the UTC format e.g.: Fri, 20 May 2022 20:05:12 GMT

{ts.iso} represents the ISO format e.g.: 2022-05-20T20:05:12.072Z

{ts.locale} represents the locale format with timeZone and locale e.g. for Europe/Berlin and de-DE: 20.5.2022, 22:05:12

{ts.locale.date} represents the date only e.g. for Europe/Berlin and de-DE: 20.5.2022

{ts.locale.time} represents the time only e.g. for Europe/Berlin and de-DE: 22:05:12

{ts.locale.long} represents the date and time as long format e.g. for Europe/Berlin and de-DE: Freitag, 20. Mai 2022, 22:05:12
```

## Commands

Press F1 or CTRL+Shift+P to open VS Code Command Palette.

- Auto-Git: Version // Shows current installed version in a notification box
- Auto-Git: Init // Initializes Auto-Git for your project
- Auto-Git: Start // Starts the interval and routine
- Auto-Git: Stop // Stops the interval and routine
- Auto-Git: Restart // Reloads configuration + stop + start
